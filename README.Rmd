# HW5

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/phytologie/HW5/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phytologie/HW5/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

The goal of HW5 is to provide an S4-based R package for working with sparse numeric vectors. The package defines a custom sparse_numeric class and implements a suite of mathematical operations that behave consistently with base R vector methods. Sparse vectors efficiently store only non-zero values and their positions, making this package useful for applications where most elements of a numeric vector are zeros.

## Installation

You can install the development version of HW5 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("phytologie/HW5")
```
